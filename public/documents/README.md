# Document Storage

This folder is used to store your financial documents for the Wealth Navigator application.

To link a document to an asset or liability:
1. Go to the "Documents" page in the application.
2. Find the ID for the item you want to add a document for (e.g., `ud1`).
3. Name your file with that exact ID (e.g., `ud1.pdf`).
4. Place the file in this directory.

The "View Document" button in the app will now open this file.
